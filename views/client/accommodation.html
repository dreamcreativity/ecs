                       For students studying in Toronto, staying in homestay can be a fantastic way to be immersed in the English language while learning about the Canadian way of life.  Most students who stay in homestay form lasting relationships with their host families and really come to feel that they have found their home away from home here in Toronto.

                       English School of Canada is partnered with Canada Homestay Network, one of the largest homestay providers in Canada.  Each student is matched with a host family based on personal details such as profession, hobbies, food preferences and personality.  Students may decide to have one, two or three meals together with the host family, or they may choose our roomstay option and have access to the kitchen and prepare their own meals.  The goal is always the same, to make the student feel relaxed and at home in their new environment.
