This program provides an immersive experience by combining English lessons, excursions and activities which all focus on improving their English skills. We host the program at the University of Toronto downtown campus, where all the action takes place; English classes, residence life, meals and group activities. There are two options available for our students: Residential and Self-arranged. The residential program is for students who live in the residence and participate in day and evening activities. Self-arranged students participate in the same program as residential, excluding evening programming. Most students in the self-arranged option live with family or relatives in the city of Toronto.
